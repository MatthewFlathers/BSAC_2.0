    Who’s the best quarterback ever? Tom Brady? Peyton Manning? Joe Montana?
    Was Matt Ryan better in 2016 than Dan Marino ever was? This is a common
    argument across sports bars and fan bases across the country, where fans
    make cases for their team’s idol to be enshrined at the top of football’s
    ultimate podium. In this article I take an analytical approach to settling
    the age-old football debate, comparing how good each quarterback was
    relative to contemporary competition.
</p>
 <p class = "no-indent">
    Before we start, we have to define what makes a good quarterback. The best
    quarterbacks throw lots of touchdowns, pass for lots of yards and throw few
    interceptions. The NFL uses passer rating, a metric that take these
    statistics into account as well as the number of attempts he had to throw
    the ball. This will be our starting point.
</p>
 <p class = "no-indent">
    One approach to ranking the best quarterback seasons would be to compare
    their passer ratings. The issue with that is that the game is constantly
    evolving; today’s quarterbacks throw more short passes with higher
    completion rates, while cornerbacks are more frequently flagged for holding
    and pass interference. Factors such as these have resulted in a dramatic
    increase in passer ratings since the AFL-NFL merger:
</p>
<p>
    <img class="center"
        src="../img/bestqb1.jpg"
    />
</p>
<p class = "no-indent">
    This ranking would exclude great quarterbacks of earlier decades. During
    the 1970s, for instance, top quarterbacks often had a passer rating of less
    than 90, while today that is below average. In fact, out of the top 20
    quarterbacks by career passer rating, just two of them retired before 2009.
    This method hardly seems fair.
</p>
<p class = "no-indent">
    Instead my approach was to compare elite quarterbacks to other top passers
    from their time. For every year since the merger, I compared each
    quarterback’s season to the top ten quarterback seasons from the five years
    surrounding it. For example, I compared Tom Brady’s historic 2007 season
    with the top ten quarterbacks in the league between 2005 and 2009. Using
    these data, I produced a standardized score for each quarterback’s season
    performance based on passer rating. A standardized score is a way of
    quantifying how well each quarterback was passing relative to other
    quarterbacks of the same era. Thus, I was able to account for the effect
    that the ever-changing rules and strategies of football had on
    quarterbacks. The top 25 quarterback seasons according to this methodology
    are listed below:

    Steve Young’s 1994 season ranks as the greatest by a substantial margin. In
    this season, his passer rating was 112.1. Even by today’s standards that
    score is high, and during that season it was more than 20 points higher
    than any other quarterback. It stood as the highest for ten years until
    Peyton Manning broke it in 2004, the second best season on the list. Other
    top seasons include Dan Marino’s 1984 season, when he passed for a record
    48 touchdowns that stood for 20 years and Tom Brady’s undefeated 2007
    season. Matt Ryan’s 2016 season ranks 6<sup>th</sup> behind Aaron Rodgers’
    2011 season when he set the single-season passer rating record of 122.5.
    Most importantly, this ranking fairly represents all quarterbacks since the
    merger, with each decade having at least four quarterbacks on the list.
</p>
<p class = "no-indent">
    I also sought to answer the question of who is the best quarterback of all
    time. My approach here was to average each quarterback’s season
    standardized scores I computed in the previous section. Only quarterbacks
    who have completed five seasons were eligible. For quarterbacks with long
    careers, I only considered their top eight seasons to give them an
    advantage over less accomplished quarterbacks. Note that many of even the
    best quarterbacks here have negative standardized scores, because my method
    compares each of their seasons to the best quarterbacks in the league each
    year.

    Once again, Steve Young leads all other quarterbacks by a wide margin. He
    benefitted by being a backup quarterback under Joe Montana for several
    years, having time to gain experience. Although he only had ten qualifying
    seasons, four of them ranked among the top 25 ever. Other top quarterbacks
    such as Peyton Manning, Joe Montana and Tom Brady have all won multiple
    superbowls, while Aaron Rodgers has consistently been at the top of the
    game over the past several years.

<p class = "no-indent">
    One notable omission is Terry Bradshaw, the Steelers quarterback who won
    four superbowls in the 1970s. In fact, he ranked just 42<sup>nd</sup> on my
    list of 127 quarterbacks who played at least five seasons. He played well
    throughout his career, yet he never led the league in passer rating.
    Instead the Steelers’ reign of dominance can be explained by their infamous
    “Steel Curtain” defense. On the other hand, quarterbacks such as Tom Brady,
    Peyton Manning and Joe Montana contributed significantly to their teams’
    dynasties.

    As a Patriots fan, I was disappointed to see Tom Brady ranked fifth
    according to my methodology and below Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers. At
    least he has the most rings. Nevertheless, this analysis isolated each
    quarterback’s performance from the team he played on and fairly compare the
    most dominant quarterbacks of each era since the merger.
